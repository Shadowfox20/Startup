            <p>Review: The game is incredible. I enjoy turn-based combat, and have played a variety of classic
              RPGs, and it is clear that the developers did as well. The combat flows so smoothly, and their
              big change-up in adding a parry mechanic makes it constantly engaging and rewarding. I also love
              that this mechanic doesn't detract from the strategic elements. For most of the game, every move
              requires at least some thought. One thing I cannot talk enough about is the story! It's one of
              those stories that leaves me thinking about it for months after. I played through as much as I
              could my first time, and I still couldn't get enough, so I played through it a second time just
              to play the story again. If you're not sure if you want to play it, just try the first hour of
              the game, and I promise you'll be hooked!
