## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Video games are massive investments, both in money and in time. On top of that, everyone has very specific tastes and preferences, and every game is appealing to a different group of people. Because of this, basic review sites don't quite cover the level of complexity that is required for video game criticosm. I want to develop a site that allows users to upload detailed reviews and generate a discussion about the games they play. Think letterboxd for games.

### Design

![Design image](Blueprint_Make_Post.jpg)

A rough sketch of how creating a post might look. Basic elements include a field to write the review, a dropdown menu to choose a rating between 1-10, a field to add tags, a field to add how many hours were spent playing the game (and possibly also completion level), and a field to add tags (such as "casual", "high-intensity" or "strategy")
