      <p>Review: The game is incredible. I enjoy turn-based combat, and have played a variety of classic RPGs, and
        it is clear that the developers did as well. The combat flows so smoothly, and their big change-up in
        adding a parry mechanic makes it constantly engaging and rewarding. I also love that this mechanic
        doesn't detract from the strategic elements. For most of the game, every move requires at least some
        thought. One thing I cannot talk enough about is the story! It's one of those stories that leaves me
        thinking about it for months after. I played through as much as I could my first time, and I still
        couldn't get enough, so I played through it a second time just to play the story again. If you're not
        sure if you want to play it, just try the first hour of the game, and I promise you'll be hooked!</p>
